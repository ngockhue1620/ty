		<h6>Dear Human Resources Department,</h6>

		<p>My name is Tran Thi Ty Ty, and I am thrilled to write this letter to apply for the <b>ADMIN INTERN</b> at Bosch Vietnam, E-town 2 Building office.</p>
	
		<p>I strongly connect with Bosch through your ambition to product quality and sustainable development strategy to protect your environment. I heard about the Bosch Group 6 months ago through a roommate who has worked here and gives good reviews about your company. I was impressed by the strict and optimal production process of components for car technology at the factory. It makes me think your company has an effective operating process. So I am excited to work and develop my professional career with this environment. I have read the recruitment information on the Facebook fanpage of Job opportunities - Internship. I believe with my good-based knowledge and preparation as well as leadership experience will make me become a potential candidate for this recruitment.</p>
	<p> I have studied my third-year at International University, and specialized in Business Administration. I am attracted to this particular position because its nature strongly resonates with my experiences, especially in terms of communication with people and job management. Therefore I can envision my best self realized through this job. In the last three years at university, my tasks were all about "leadership, planning, and reporting". Specifically in the start-up project about Psychological Website, as a leader, I plan project development, allocate resources, and solve unexpected problems. By studying in the English environment at my university, I have proficient in English skills, so that I am strongly confident in working with English documents as well as working with foreigners. Besides, I gained a GPA of 84.1/100 until the latest semester.
</p>
	<p>I believe my biggest leverage setting me apart is my ability to learn quickly and hard-working. In the IU English Club, I was able to ramp up knowledge in different skills and drive to impactful insights in a matter of only a few weeks. Sometimes, I do not know the way to solve the problem, but I am a person who knows how to find the answer, and I will try my best to do so. This learning attitude is critical to success. Moreover, I can produce good outputs, thanks to the success of the IELTS Practice Test program, the sponsor - Summit wishes to continue cooperating in any program next time.
</p>
	<p>I hope my application and this letter find you well. I am looking forward to speaking to you very soon to discuss how I can bring tangible value to Bosch in this particular role.
</p>
	
	<p><i>Best regards,</i></p>
	<p><i>Tran Thi Ty Ty</i></p>
