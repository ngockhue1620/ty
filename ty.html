		<h6>To whom it may concerns,</h6>

		<p>My name is TRAN THI TY TY, and I am thrilled to write this letter to apply for the  <b>ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE,
	CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS</b> at Google, Toronto office.</p>
	
		<p>You may find me familiar, as I did apply to Google Singapore for the position of Associate Product
	Marketing Manager back in July 2018. I have said it and am repeating it now that Google is THE
	company I have dreamt of working for since I was very young.</p>
	<p>I strongly connect with Google through your ambition to innovate and change the world. In daily life,
	I cannot imagine if I can ever navigate without Google Maps or quickly learn complex problems
	without Google Search or YouTube, including writing this very cover letter. Professionally, I like that
	AdSense and Gmail were born out of the 20-percent time policy allowing all employees to explore
	moon-shot projects. Emotionally, I still recall 'Dear Sophie' and 'Jess Time' as some of the most
	emotional ads I've ever seen that make sense of what tech means to our human connections.</p>
	<p>I am attracted to this particular position because its natures strongly resonate with my experiences.
	Therefore I can envision my best self realized through this job. In the last six years, my jobs were all
	about "consulting, business development, and marketing". Specifically in BCG, consulted C-suite on
	growth strategies and large-scale transformation. I was a key account manager for the two largest
	retailers in Vietnam in Nielsen, developed new product innovations, and secured new clients.</p>
	<p>However, I believe my biggest leverage setting me apart is my ability to learn quickly and
	resourcefully. In BCG, I was able to ramp up knowledge in different and unfamiliar industries and
	drive to impactful insights in a matter of only a few weeks. This learning attitude is critical to success,
	as Google CEO Pichai himself estimated that '50 percent of all employees would need reskilling by
	2025'. Moreover, I can produce complex outputs, say Excel financial models or consulting quality
	slides, in very short turn-around times.</p>
	<p>I hope my application and this letter find you well. I am looking forward to speaking to you very soon
	to discuss how I can bring tangible value to Google in this particular role.</p>
	<p><i>Best regards,</i></p>
	<p><i>Tran Thi Ty Ty</i></p>
